        <h2>Favorite music</h2>

        <p>
            Im sure you have not heard of this genre but I like Hyperpop. That said it is <strong>VERY</strong> hard to find Hyperpop songs let 
            alone good Hyperpop songs. some songs I've been listening to is 1:15 by 8485, Name, Name, and the entirety of the Hamilton musical, 
            which is of course not a Hyperpop song but I've been listening to it so much that I should definitely include it.
