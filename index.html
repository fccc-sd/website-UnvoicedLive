        <h2>Music</h2>

        <p>
            Im sure you have not heard of this genre but I like Hyperpop. That said it is <strong>VERY</strong> hard to find Hyperpop <br>
            songs let alone good Hyperpop songs. some songs I've been listening to is 1:15 by 8485, Name, Name, and the <br>
            entirety of the Hamilton musical, which is of course not a Hyperpop song but I've been listening to it so <br>
            much that I should definitely include it.
