            Im sure you have not heard of this genre but I like Hyperpop. That said it is <strong>VERY</strong> hard to find Hyperpop <br>
            songs let alone good Hyperpop songs. some songs I've been listening to is 1:15 by 8485, SugarCrash! by <br>
            ElyOtto, Yout favorite sidekick by Underscores, and the entirety of the Hamilton musical, which is of course <br>
            not a Hyperpop song but I've been listening to it so much that I should definitely include it.
